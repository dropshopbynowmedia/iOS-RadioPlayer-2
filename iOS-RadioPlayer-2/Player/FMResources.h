/**
 
 This class exposes static functions that make it easy to display
 the various music player views.
 
 If you just want a music player to be presented on the screen that
 the user can back out of, then use `+ (void) presentPlayerWithTitle:`.
 That method tries to find the frontmost view controller and present
 the music player from there. If you want a different view controller
 to present it, then use the
 `+ (void) presentPlayerFromViewController:WithTitle:` method.
 
 If you want to display the music player within a UINavigationController,
 you can create an instance of the player with one of the
 `+ (void) createPlayerViewController` methods and then push it onto
 the current navigation controller.
 
 The player displays a single station at a time. If you want to display
 a grid of stations, then use the `+ (void) createStationCollectionViewController`
 methods.
